📚 Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on various characteristics of mushrooms, such as cap color, cap shape, and stalk color. The mushrooms are labeled as either edible or poisonous.

🧠 Methodology
The project uses various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to classify the mushrooms. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision.

📈 Results
The results show that machine learning can be highly effective in identifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous, with some algorithms achieving an accuracy of over 99%. However, it is important to note that the dataset used in this project may not be representative of all mushrooms and further research is needed to determine the generalizability of the results.

🔧 Usage
To run the code, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Scikit-learn
Keras
You can then run the code by executing the main.py file.

📚 Conclusion
This project demonstrates that machine learning can be a powerful tool in identifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous. However, further research is needed to determine the generalizability of the results and to develop more robust and accurate models.

🍄 Happy (and safe) mushroom hunting! 🍄
Note: This is just a simulation, it's important to always consult a professional mycologist and/or a local expert before consuming any wild mushroom. Some mushrooms are quite similar and require a professional to tell them apart.
